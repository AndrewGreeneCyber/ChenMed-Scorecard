# ‚öôÔ∏è Scoring Methodology

Each **driver** within the scorecard contributes to the total evaluation score based on its assigned point value.  

- ‚úÖ **Meets Expectation (ME):** Full points are retained ‚Äî no deductions applied.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Improvement (NI):** Points for that attribute are deducted from the total score based on driver's worth.  
- üö´ **Not Applicable (N/A):** Attribute is excluded from scoring ‚Äî no points gained or lost.  

# üîè Compliance Auto-Fail

The **Compliance attribute** is non-negotiable.  
If any compliance driver is missed or marked **Needs Improvement**, the entire evaluation automatically receives a **0% score**. If Scored **Meets Expectation** Attribute's worth may or may not contribute to overall evaluation score. 

Agents should therefore always strive to meet expectations under this attribute to avoid triggering an auto-fail.
