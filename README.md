# üß© QA Form Structure and Design Improvements Proposal

## 1. Attribute and Driver Framework
My form converts each attribute question into a written statement.  
Under each attribute, I list the related questions as **drivers** (or **behaviors**, if preferred).  

This approach makes the form easier to use, simplifies reporting, and allows feedback to be more precise.  
In the future, if any updates are needed, we can retain the main attribute and simply revise or replace the drivers ‚Äî ensuring long-term scalability and consistency.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Reassurance & Issue Confirmation

This attribute sets clear parameters for how reassurance should be provided during a call.  
Specifically, it ensures that the **willingness to assist** is expressed **after confirming the issue**, but **before** giving information to resolve the caller‚Äôs concern.  

‚úÖ Strengthens trust and clarity in the interaction.  


---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Professionalism

Created a **Professionalism** attribute that evaluates:  
- Background noise  
- Tone  
- Rude or abrupt behavior  

This ensures every call reflects a respectful, focused, and professional interaction.  


---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Patient Empathy & VIP Experience

Created a **Patient Empathy & VIP Experience** attribute that measures:  
- Tone adaptation  
- Personalization opportunities  
- Ownership  

Focuses on how well agents tailor communication, connect with the caller, and take responsibility for resolution.  

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Emotional Regulation & De-escalation</summary>

Developed an **Emotional Regulation & De-escalation** attribute that addresses:  
- Emotional adaptation  
- Frustration acknowledgment  
- Conflict de-escalation  

Evaluates how effectively an agent manages emotions ‚Äî both their own and the caller‚Äôs ‚Äî to maintain calm, constructive conversations.  

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Documentation: Phone Messages & Tasks

Created a **Documentation** attribute for **Phone Messages and Tasks** that maintains our current standards while adding flexibility.  

If a phone message or task was **not required** for the call type, it can be marked **N/A**, preventing unfair scoring deductions.  

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Transfers & Escalations

Consolidated **Transfers** and **Escalations** into one attribute: **Transfers and Escalations**.  

- Scored **N/A** if no transfer or escalation was required.  
- Keeps evaluations relevant and concise.  

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Scheduling & Coordination

Merged **Appointments, Transportation, Refills, and Referrals** into one attribute: **Scheduling & Coordination**.  

- Scored when those actions are required.  
- Mark **N/A** when not applicable.  

Ensures adaptability across multiple interaction types.  

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Information Accuracy

Created an **Information Accuracy** attribute that ideally applies to **every interaction**.  

Evaluates:  
- Proper probing questions  
- Accuracy of provided information  
- Communication adjusted for the caller‚Äôs skill or comprehension level  


---

## üîü Compliance & Auto-Fails

Added a **Compliance & Auto-Fails** attribute that applies to **every single call**.  

- **Meets Expectations:** Agent follows all required protocols ‚Äî points awarded.  
- **Auto-Fail:** Any breach of compliance standards automatically fails the form.  

Ensures accountability, consistency, and strict policy adherence.  

---

### ‚úÖ Summary
This QA form design introduces a structured, behavior-based evaluation model that enhances clarity, fairness, and flexibility.  
By grouping related competencies, defining N/A scenarios, and ensuring compliance consistency, it strengthens data accuracy, coaching precision, and overall quality insights.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Scoring Methodology

Each **driver** within the scorecard contributes to the total evaluation score based on its assigned point value.  

- ‚úÖ **Meets Expectation (ME):** Full points are retained ‚Äî no deductions applied.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Improvement (NI):** Points for that attribute are deducted from the total score based on driver's worth.  
- üö´ **Not Applicable (N/A):** Attribute is excluded from scoring ‚Äî no points gained or lost.  

# üîè Compliance Auto-Fail

The **Compliance attribute** is non-negotiable.  
If any compliance driver is missed or marked **Needs Improvement**, the entire evaluation automatically receives a **0% score**. If Scored **Meets Expectation** Attribute's worth may or may not contribute to overall evaluation score. 

Agents should therefore always strive to meet expectations under this attribute to avoid triggering an auto-fail. 

# üß† General Scoring Principles

- **Default to Coaching, Not Penalizing:** If you‚Äôre torn between ME and NI, default to **ME** and add a coaching note instead of a deduction.
- **N/A Is Not a Shortcut:** Only mark N/A when an attribute genuinely didn‚Äôt apply to the call, not because the advisor missed the opportunity.
- **NI Requires Repetition or Impact:** Use NI when the issue clearly affects the patient experience, creates confusion, or breaks compliance.
- **Always Add Context:** Each score (especially NI or N/A) must include a brief comment explaining *why* it was chosen ‚Äî this ensures calibration and transparency.
