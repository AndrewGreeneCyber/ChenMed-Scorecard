# ⚙️ Scoring Methodology

Each **driver** within the scorecard contributes to the total evaluation score based on its assigned point value.  

- ✅ **Meets Expectation (ME):** Full points are retained — no deductions applied.  
- ⚠️ **Needs Improvement (NI):** Points for that attribute are deducted from the total score based on driver's worth.  
- 🚫 **Not Applicable (N/A):** Attribute is excluded from scoring — no points gained or lost.  

# 🔏 Compliance Auto-Fail

The **Compliance attribute** is non-negotiable.  
If any compliance driver is missed or marked **Needs Improvement**, the entire evaluation automatically receives a **0% score**. If Scored **Meets Expectation** Attribute's worth may or may not contribute to overall evaluation score. 

Agents should therefore always strive to meet expectations under this attribute to avoid triggering an auto-fail. 

# 🧠 General Scoring Principles

- **Default to Coaching, Not Penalizing:** If you’re torn between ME and NI, default to **ME** and add a coaching note instead of a deduction.
- **N/A Is Not a Shortcut:** Only mark N/A when an attribute genuinely didn’t apply to the call, not because the advisor missed the opportunity.
- **NI Requires Repetition or Impact:** Use NI when the issue clearly affects the patient experience, creates confusion, or breaks compliance.
- **Always Add Context:** Each score (especially NI or N/A) must include a brief comment explaining *why* it was chosen — this ensures calibration and transparency.
